For the DriverPass project, the client was a driving school company that needed a system to help students schedule driving lessons, take practice exams, and make payments, while also allowing instructors and administrators to manage schedules and track student progress. I designed a system that included different users like students, instructors, administrators, and a payment processor, and mapped out the key features and interactions through diagrams and descriptions. 
One part of the project I did particularly well was breaking down the scheduling process clearly so that it would be easy for students to follow. If I could revise one part of my work, I would probably spend more time simplifying some of the diagrams to make them even easier to read at a glance. When designing the system, I focused on interpreting the user's needs by thinking through how each type of user would interact with DriverPass and what steps they would expect to see. Considering the user's needs is essential because it ensures the system is actually useful, intuitive, and efficient for the people relying on it. When I approach designing software, I like to use diagrams and user stories to map out the flow of information and actions. In the future, I would also include more detailed feedback loops during the design phase to catch problems earlier and improve the final product.
